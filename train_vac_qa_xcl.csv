0,"My son, 9 has his shots including his kindergarten chicken pox. His doc suggested I look into the need for a chicken pox booster. Is a secondary chicken pox vaccine recommended?
","The chickenpox vaccine is given to children as a series of two doses. The first dose is given at 12 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.  If your son has received 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine, he has received the recommended amount. If he has only received one, please contact your immunization provider. You will find more information about chicken pox here.

","Nearly all Canadians 50 years of age and older will have had chickenpox, even if it cannot be recalled. Routine serological (blood) testing is not recommended. SHINGRIX® is indicated for the prevention of shingles in individuals 50 years of age and older with prior chickenpox infection.  There is no known safety risk associated with vaccination of healthy individuals who are non-immune to chickenpox with SHINGRIX®. Learn about the shingles vaccines here.
In BC, it is rare for individuals 50 years of age and older to need the chickenpox vaccine. Speak with a public health nurse at your local health unit. Find a location near you here.

","Children can usually get vaccinated if they have a mild common illness like a cold, ear infection, or diarrhea. Mild common diseases do not interfere with the immune response to vaccines and do not increase the risk of adverse events following immunization. Children taking antibiotics can also receive vaccines as antibiotics do not interfere with the immune response to the vaccine. If you have questions about whether or not your child should be vaccinated, we recommend that you speak with your immunizing health care provider.

		How often virus of polio, MMR and meningococcal are mutated-It is not clear what you are asking in this question. 

		It can take 10 years or longer for a vaccine to be developed, tested, and finally approved for use by Health Canada. Read more here.

		Refer to the History of Immunization in BC for which vaccines were used at what time in BC's vaccine programs.

		Refer to Health Canada Drug Product Database to find the product monographs and  information on any changes to vaccines approved in Canada.

","Tips for locating immunization records are here. Contact the health unit where you lived as a child, use the health unit finder. Documentation from 1960s will be challenging to obtain, especially if vaccines were given by your doctor.  In general:

		Persons born before 1970 (except health care workers) are considered immune to measles and mumps from having these diseases in childhood.

		Blood tests can be done for a few vaccine preventable diseases, but the need for these tests should be discussed with your health care provider.

		ImmunizeBC does not have a timeline for blood tests/results.

		Without a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection. It is safe to repeat vaccines. The schedule for these adults is located here.

","Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly communicable (easily spread) bacterial illness. Persons who have had pertussis infection should receive pertussis-containing vaccines as recommended because infection does not confer long term immunity.
Adults should receive one dose of Tdap vaccine if they have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood, but is not provided for free in BC.

","Please speak with your health care provider about your last Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine, your reaction afterwards and plans for a booster dose. Reporting of unexpected reactions after vaccines is important to vaccine safety and reporting of adverse events following immunization.
What you described could have been an arthus reaction; it is a large, localized reaction characterized by pain, swelling, and redness. The reaction can form when there is a large amount of circulating tetanus antibodies already in your body prior to injection of the tetanus vaccine. This results in extensive swelling at the injection site. Most arthus reactions resolve within one week. Typically if an arthus reaction occurs with a tetanus-containing booster, future boosters can be spaced at longer intervals.

22,"I had GBS (full paralysis, 20yrs ago) not associated with immunization. I have had the flu shot numerous time since. Am I putting myself at greater risk of GBS recurring by getting the yearly flu shot?
","Individuals who developed Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) within 8 weeks of a previous dose of tetanus toxoid or influenza vaccine should not be re-immunized with that product. Individuals who have developed GBS outside this interval or who have a different etiology (cause) confirmed may receive subsequent doses of tetanus and/or influenza vaccines.
While its cause of GBS is not fully understood, the syndrome often follows infection with a virus or bacteria. If you have more questions, please speak with your health care provider about your health history and risk of GBS from influenza virus versus vaccine. Studies suggest that it is more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu than after vaccination. It is important to keep in mind that severe illness and death are associated with flu, and getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent flu infection and its complications.

The pertussis vaccine is given as the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Read more about vaccines in pregnancy here.
Babies don't start getting the pertussis vaccine until they are two months old. When you get the pertussis vaccine, your body makes protective antibodies.

		persons with functional or anatomic asplenia

		persons with congenital complement, properdin, factor D or primary antibody deficiencies

		persons with acquired complement deficiency due to receipt of the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab (Soliris„¢)

		travellers to areas with high rates of endemic meningococcal disease or transmission, including travellers to the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa and pilgrims to the Hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia

		research, industrial and clinical laboratory personnel who may be at risk of exposure to N. meningitidis

		military personnel who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease

		HIV positive individuals should be considered for vaccination, especially if HIV is congenitally acquired
We recommend that you follow up with your health care provider who can make an individual recommendation for you regarding Men-B vaccination.

","If you are referring to influenza (flu) vaccine, here is some information you may be interested in. The publicly funded (free) influenza vaccine is purchased by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with money allocated by the Ministry of Health and is distributed through the local health authorities.  The provincial supply of the publicly funded influenza vaccine is determined prior to the actual influenza season based on information from each of the health authorities.  Thus, each health authority receives a pre-determined amount of the publicly-funded vaccine.
Depending on the particular demand in a given year, in a specific area or at a specific location, sometimes select clinics may run out of the publicly funded vaccine. The publicly funded vaccine is available from a variety of vaccine providers, including public health clinics, pharmacies, travel clinics and some doctors' offices.

","A blood test to confirm immunity to (protection against) the hepatitis B virus is not routinely recommended when there has been a delay between vaccine doses.

","Extensive research has shown no evidence that the HPV vaccine can cause infertility. In fact, HPV cancers can lead to issues with fertility. The HPV vaccine protects against cancers caused by HPV. You can learn more about the HPV vaccine here. 
The HPV vaccine is very safe. Vaccines are approved for use in Canada only if they meet very strict standards for safety and effectiveness. The HPV vaccine was well studied in clinical trials and was not approved for use in Canada until the studies showed that it was safe and effective. Since vaccine licensure, hundreds of millions of doses of HPV vaccines have been distributed worldwide. Vaccine safety monitoring has continued to show that the HPV vaccine is safe.

The influenza vaccine is the best way to protect against influenza, a serious and sometimes fatal infection.

57,"If I already had the flu shot, why am I still getting the flu?
","There are a number of reasons why people may get influenza (flu)-like symptoms even after they have been vaccinated against influenza:

		A person may become ill from other respiratory viruses that cause symptoms similar to influenza, like respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, or parainfluenza. There are many different types of viruses that can cause influenza-like symptoms.  The influenza vaccines only protect against influenza, not other illnesses.

		 It's possible to be exposed to an influenza virus shortly before getting vaccinated or during the two-week period after vaccination that it takes the body to develop immune protection. 

		A person may be exposed to an influenza virus that the vaccine does not protect against. There are many different influenza viruses. The influenza vaccine protects against the strains of influenza viruses that health experts think will cause influenza during that particular season. 

		The influenza vaccine can vary in how well it works and some people who get vaccinated may still get sick. 

		Some people mistake the ""stomach flu"" for influenza.  Influenza vaccines do not protect against the viruses or bacteria that cause stomach illnesses, often called the stomach flu. Influenza is a respiratory illness and not a stomach illness.

According to the Canadian Immunization Guide, annual vaccination is required because the body's immune response from vaccination diminishes ""within a year"".

85,"With the mumps epidemic going around, I was wondering if my daughters born in 1998- and 2000 have the correct vaccines to protect them?
","The mumps vaccine is combined with the measles and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine).  People born in BC in 1998 and 2000 would have likely been offered two doses of the MMR vaccine as part of their routine immunizations. 
We recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can review your daughters' immunization records and let you know if they are missing any recommended vaccines. 
The provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.  There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak. 
Mumps vaccine recommendations:
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:

		children as per the routine schedule

		students of post-secondary educational settings

		travelers to outside of North America
People born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.    
For measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).
An important note about immunization records:
Without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity to a disease, a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected.  You can find tips on locating immunization records here. 
Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. For more information on the MMR vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
For information about mumps disease, see the HealthLinkBC File: Mumps.

However, for doses of vaccine to be considered valid, they do have to meet criteria for timing between doses (e.g. 4-8 weeks between doses) and minimum age (e.g. 6 months of age for influenza vaccine).

","Some vaccines are made from live germs or toxins, which need to be killed or made inactive so they do not cause disease.  Formaldehyde is used to do this, and then it is diluted during the vaccine manufacturing process.  Residual quantities of formaldehyde may be found in some vaccines, however this tiny amount does not pose a safety concern. 
Formaldehyde is naturally occurring in the human body and helps with metabolism.  There is approximately 10 times the amount of formaldehyde in a baby's body at any one time than there is in a vaccine. Humans break down formaldehyde quickly, so it does not build up in the body.
Vaccines are made with ingredients that make them safe and effective.  If you have questions or concerns regarding any of the ingredients in vaccines, we encourage you to talk to a public health nurse or your primary health care provider.

","Immunization is not mandatory in BC. However, it is strongly recommended that children are immunized according to the routine schedule and that they get all vaccines on time.  All of the recommended vaccines are important and protect children against diseases that can cause serious illness and even death. Skipping vaccines leaves children at risk for serious diseases at a time when they need protection most.

","The MR vaccine offered to children in 1996 as part of a province-wide campaign provided protection against measles and rubella. This vaccine did not provide protection against mumps. The mumps vaccine is combined with the measles and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine).  People born in 1991 in BC would have likely received one dose of the MMR vaccine as part of their routine immunizations. 
If you are unsure if your immunizations are up-to-date, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can review your immunization records and let you know if you are missing any recommended vaccines.  
The provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.  There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak. 
Mumps vaccine recommendations:
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:

		children as per the routine schedule

		students of post-secondary educational settings

		travelers to outside of North America
People born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.    
For measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).
Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. For more information on the MMR vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
For information about mumps disease, see the HealthLinkBC File: Mumps.

","If possible, it's advised that you attempt to obtain your son's immunization records from your previous health care provider.  You can find tips on locating immunization records here.   
A child without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity, is considered unimmunized and unprotected.  In general, it is advised that children without written documentation of immunization get immunized according to the schedule for their current age.  Getting extra doses of vaccine is not harmful and ensures protection. We recommend that you discuss this further with your public health nurse or doctor. 
It's also advised that you take your son's immunization record (even if it is incomplete) to your local public health unit to be checked. Vaccine recommendations and schedules differ between countries.  A public health nurse can review your son's record and recommend and provide any missing vaccines.

","In BC, there are 2 live vaccines that you may have received in the past where scab would form after vaccine adminstration and leave a scar at the adminstration site. 
Smallpox [Vaccinia] Vaccine: After smallpox was eliminated from the world, routine vaccination against smallpox was stopped because it was no longer needed.  In BC, we stopped giving smallpox vaccine in 1980. The smallpox vaccine was given by a special technique that caused a blister which formed a scab and when the scab fell off, it left a scar (usually in the deltoid area of the upper arm).
Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) Vaccine: The BCG vaccine is not currently recommended for routine use in any Canadian population. In BC, the BCG vaccine was discontinued for health care workers in the 1970s and in 2003 the program was discontinued in BC First Nations communities.The BCG vaccine is given intradermally (under the superficial layers of the skin) that forms a papule (small raised swelling) or ulceration (sore on the skin in 50% of people) that leads to a scar (usually in the deltoid area of the upper arm).

","Shingles is a painful skin rash with blisters. In some people who have had chickenpox, the virus becomes active again later in life and causes shingles. You cannot contract shingles from another person. 
The Shingrix® vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of getting shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) by more than 90% after two doses. The vaccine is given as two doses, at least two to six months apart. Protection might not be attained until the recommended number of doses has been administered.

","The chickenpox (varicella) vaccine is a live vaccine given by injection (paternally). Dukoral is an inactivated Cholera and ETEC Diarrhea Vaccine taken by mouth (orally). If you have questions about a travel vaccine and how to take it, speak with the travel health care provider that prescribed the vaccine.
As a general principle, live vaccines and inactivated vaccines do not interfere with one another, so they don't need to be separated by any time frame. Live vaccines are made from a weakened version of the germ (virus or bacteria) that causes the disease. Inactivated vaccines are made from a killed germ (or parts of the germ for subunit vaccines) that causes the disease. Since the vaccine does not contain a live germ, there is no growth of the germ in the vaccinated person.

","A toxoid vaccine protects against the toxin made by certain bacteria (e.g. tetanus). Toxoid vaccines are safe because they cannot cause the disease they prevent. The toxin has been inactivated (killed) so it has been made harmless, but it teaches the immune system to recognize and protect you against that bacteria (e.g. diphtheria). According to the History of Immunization in BC, in the 1940s the following vaccines were offered for protection against diphtheria and tetanus:

		TABT vaccine 1943 Tetanus toxoid, typhoid, paratyphoid A and B

		DPT 1948 Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus

		Diphtheria (40 LF) and tetanus (DT) 1948 Primary immunization only

","Yes. The same virus that causes chickenpox (the varicella-zoster virus) causes shingles. For some people who have had chickenpox, the virus can become active again later in life and cause a painful rash with blisters called shingles.  
People can also get shingles after getting the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine. However, people who get the chickenpox vaccine are less likely to have shingles later in life than people who have had chickenpox disease. Learn more about shingles and the 2 approved vaccines here.

260,"Do people who only had one MMR dose (likely born between 1979 and 1995) need a second dose to protect against mumps?
","The provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.  There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak. 
Mumps vaccine recommendations:
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:

		children as per the routine schedule

		students of post-secondary educational settings

		travelers to outside of North America
People born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.    
For measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).
If you are unsure if your immunizations are up-to-date, we recommend that you contact your immunizing health care provider (public health nurse, physician or pharmacist). Your immunizing health care provider can review your immunization records and let you know if you are missing any vaccines. 
An important note about immunization records:
Without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity to a disease, a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected.  You can find tips on locating immunization records here. 
Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. For more information on the MMR vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
For information about mumps disease, see the HealthLinkBC File: Mumps.

","Inactivated vaccines are generally safe in pregnancy. Tetanus is an inactivated vaccine. If a pregnant woman is due for a tetanus shot, there is no cost. The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine may be recommended for pregnant women at 26 weeks of pregnancy or later who have not received a dose of pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood. This dose is not routinely provided for free in B.C. Speak to your health care provider about this. Or, you can call your local community health centre/public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the number here.

","Most vaccines require more than one dose over time to produce immunity and long-lasting protection. After an inactivated vaccine like Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine, it takes a couple of weeks for memory cells to develop (memory cells remember how to fight off the infection in the future).
Inactivated vaccines are made from a killed germ that causes the disease. Inactivated vaccines like Td require more than one dose. In general, the first dose €œprimes€ the immune system and the second and/or third dose produces a protective immune response. Immunity from the Td vaccine declines with time and tetanus-containing booster doses are needed to ensure continued tetanus protection at least every 10 years.

","We assume you are referring to swelling and redness at the injection site. Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site are common reactions to vaccines. These reactions generally last one to two days but can sometimes last longer.
If you have concerns regarding a vaccine reaction, it is recommended that you contact the health care provider that gave you the vaccine. Pain and swelling can be managed with cold compresses at the injection site and acetaminophen, if needed. Avoid pressure on the injection site.
Pain or redness, or swelling that extends past the nearest joint (shoulder or elbow) or that persists for 10 days or more should be reported to the health care provider that gave the vaccine. It is important to always report unexpected or serious reactions to a health care provider so that they can be investigated further.

Vaccines are very safe. Hepatitis B vaccine is an inactivated vaccine. Inactivated vaccines contain whole or parts of an inactivated (killed) bacteria or viruses and cannot cause the disease they are designed to prevent. In general, it is not harmful to give extra doses of the routine childhood vaccines.  An extra dose stimulates the immune system to be even more protective.

","We recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse. However, you may also want to consider the following information.
Before vaccines are given together, studies must show that the vaccines are just as safe and effective when given together as they are when given separately. Research shows that vaccine side effects, such as temporary pain or swelling at the injection site, are similar when vaccines are given together as when given separately.
Getting more than one vaccine at a time means your child is protected as quickly as possible during the time when they are most vulnerable, and it also means fewer clinic visits.
Your baby's immune system is amazing. From the day your baby is born, their immune system is constantly working to protect them against the thousands of germs (viruses and bacteria) that they are exposed to as part of daily life. Vaccines represent a much smaller challenge than this daily exposure, and even a combination vaccine is easy for your baby's immune system to handle. In fact, scientists estimate that a baby's immune system could theoretically handle thousands of vaccines even if they were given at the same time.

In particular, adults who have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine, ideally administered at least 2 weeks before contact with the infant.  Ensuring your pertussis vaccination is up-to-date can provide indirect protection to infants.
However, due to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC, an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood.  Those not eligible for the free vaccine can purchase the vaccine at most pharmacies and travel clinics.  A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown (adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization are considered unimmunized). Those eligible for the free vaccine can get vaccinated at their local public health unit or pharmacy.  Some family doctors also provide immunizations.

","Influenza season in Canada generally runs from November through April. In BC, influenza vaccines are usually available starting in October. Though you can receive this vaccine at any time during the influenza season, for best protection, you should get immunized as early as possible. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against influenza virus infection. The influenza the body's immune response from vaccination declines over time and that's why it's important to get the vaccine annually.

","An immunized 4 month old child will have some protection against the vaccine-preventable diseases in which they were immunized against at 2 and 4 months. However, a child of this age will have not received all of the vaccines needed for full protection.  Thus, this child would be at risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child if the unvaccinated child were to catch that disease. Further, infants and young children are at higher risk of serious illness if they were to catch a vaccine-preventable disease due to their immature immune systems and physical development.  Once a child has received all of their immunizations, their risk of contracting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child (or adult) decreases.  
There may be many instances in which your child may be in an environment in which there may be people who are not immunized.  It is important to weigh the risks and benefits in making the decision as to whether you want your child to be in that environment.  We encourage you to discuss this further with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse.  You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here: http://immunizebc.ca/finder.

","We do not have a list of vaccines that people would have been offered according to year. There is however a section within the BCCDC Immunization Manual that informs health care providers of which vaccines were recommended when. 
If you are wondering which vaccines you may have received as a child, your health care provider can consult the manual and give you an indication of which vaccines you may have received. However, without adequate documentation of immunization (an immunization record) or proof of immunity, a person is considered to be unimmunized and unprotected.

","In BC, decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations by the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee.  This expert committee makes recommendations based on epidemiology, the best available scientific evidence, a cost benefit analysis and the advice of national and international expert groups, which are then prioritized against other public health initiatives.

","The MMR and Varicella vaccines are both live injectable vaccines. If two live injectable vaccines are given too close together, the immune response to the second vaccine may be affected by the first vaccine.  To minimize this possibility, two or more live injectable vaccines should be administered concurrently or separated by an interval of at least four weeks. If two or more live injectable vaccines are not given on the same day or separated by an interval of at least four weeks (as appears to be the case in the scenario you described), the vaccine that was given second should be repeated four weeks after it was given.

","We recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse.  If following this discussion you decide that you would still like for your child to receive only one vaccine at a time (per clinic visit) this can be accommodated.
Some information to consider: A number of studies have shown that there is no greater risk for side effects when vaccines are given together (at the same clinic visit) than if they were to be given individually.  For best protection, it is recommended that children are immunized according to the routine schedule.  Spacing out or delaying vaccines leaves children at risk for serious diseases when they need the protection most. Spacing out or delaying vaccines also increases the number of office visits and time spent getting your child's shots.

The recommended schedule starting at 2 months of age, protects infants and children by providing immunity early in life, before they come into contact with life-threatening diseases.

The consequences of these diseases can be very serious, even life-threatening, for infants and young children. For more information, check here.

","There is no mandatory childhood vaccine program in BC or any jurisdiction in Canada.

		In BC, there is not a requirement to provide immunization records or documentation of valid exemptions to immunization to public health. Public health staff obtains immunization records of children through a voluntary process.  These records are entered into the immunization registry, and available for rapid retrieval when needed; the information is also used to remind children/ parents about needed vaccines.

		In a voluntary process (current model in BC), when a large proportion of children have undocumented immunizations, this can lead to major disruption in a school when there is an outbreak. Standard public health control measures for measles, for example, require exclusion of non-immune children from school. Undocumented children are considered non-immune until proven otherwise.

		In other parts of Canada, several provinces require immunization records or documentation of valid exemptions to immunization for attendance at school and/or childcare. Valid exemptions include medical reasons why a child cannot be vaccinated or parental objections, which can be due to religious or other reasons.

		Mandatory documentation of children's immunization status results in more complete records. The benefits of having records of immunization of children in public health immunization registries are many. These include the ability to recall children for scheduled vaccines, to monitor trends in vaccine uptake over time and identify vulnerable populations, and the ability to act quickly in the event of an outbreak.

","If a person has already been ill with an influenza-like illness this season, it is still recommended that they get the influenza vaccine. This is because the influenza vaccine protects against three or four different influenza viruses, which means even if someone was sick with one influenza virus, the vaccine will still offer protection against two or three other influenza viruses.  Vaccination is also important because unless someone tested positive for an influenza virus, they cannot be sure that it was an influenza virus that made them ill as there are other respiratory viruses circulating along with influenza that can cause influenza-like symptoms.

407,"How do I know if my children and I are up to date for the mumps vaccine?
","The mumps vaccine is combined with the measles and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine).
It is recommended that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine as per the routine schedule.  
If you are unsure if your children are up-to-date with their immunizations, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can review their immunization records and let you know if they are missing any vaccines. 
The provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.  There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak. 
Mumps vaccine recommendations:
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:

		children as per the routine schedule

		students of post-secondary educational settings

		travelers to outside of North America
People born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.    
For measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).
Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. For more information on the MMR vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
For information about mumps disease, see the HealthLinkBC File: Mumps.

","Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that all adults receive one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if they have not previously received a pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood. In particular, adults who have not previously received a pertussis-containing vaccine in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine. Ensuring your pertussis vaccination is up-to-date can provide indirect protection to infants.
Due to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC, an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood.  A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown.  Those not eligible for the free vaccine can purchase it at most pharmacies and travel clinics

Ongoing research is being done on the HPV vaccines and prevention of oropharyngeal cancers. The Canadian Immunization Guide explains that cancers of the oropharynx have been increasing in the developing world, with up to 70% of new oropharyngeal cases being attributed to HPV in North America and Western Europe.

438,"Does an adult get the same amount of vaccine than a baby? how do you decide how much to give if not by weight? if a child is underweight would waiting make more sense?
","Vaccines do not work like medications so in many cases the same vaccine dose can be given to different age groups; however, in some cases, different versions of vaccines are available for different age groups. There are specific adult and pediatric versions of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines. With hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines, adults receive greater quantities of the components that give protection in order to produce a protective response. However, in the case of the latter vaccines, the quantities of components of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines used in adults are less than those found in pediatric doses because adults are more likely to experience side effects from these vaccines.
People are sometimes concerned about the dosing of vaccines because they compare them with medications, which are given in different doses based on body weight. This is like comparing apples and oranges. Medications work when a certain level is present in the bloodstream; so, the weight of a person is important. It takes more of a medicine to see the same effect in a larger person than it does in a smaller person. This is similar to the effects of alcohol on a large man and a small woman.
Vaccines work differently. For a vaccine to be effective, the cells of the immune system are important. Immune cells, called T cells and B cells, must be able to recognize the component of the vaccine, so that if a person comes into contact with that virus or bacteria again, these educated cells can become active and protect the person from an infection. Since these cells are throughout the body, they are usually educated near where the vaccine is given and then the cells, not the vaccines, travel throughout the body. Because of the way that vaccines work, they typically require very low quantities of active ingredients.
During the phases of vaccine development, different doses are tested to determine the lowest effective dose for the target age group.
We do not recommend delaying immunization in underweight children for the reasons above. We recommend following the recommended schedule in order to protect the child as soon as possible.

","Human serum immunoglobulin (Ig) does not provide long term immunity to measles. When an individual is not immune to measles and then exposed to the virus, Ig is given to those who are unable to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. (e.g., infants less than 6 months, pregnant women, severely immune compromised etc).
Individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals. However, because you received Ig for a measles exposure in 1965, please speak with your health care provider and discuss your history of Ig, measles-containing vaccine and any history of measles disease.

","The publicly funded (free) influenza vaccine is purchased by the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) with money allocated by the Ministry of Health and is distributed through the local health authorities.  The provincial supply of the publicly funded influenza vaccine is determined prior to the actual influenza season based on information from each of the health authorities.  Thus, each health authority receives a pre-determined amount of the publicly-funded vaccine.
Depending on the particular demand in a given year, in a specific area or at a specific location, sometimes select clinics may run out of the publicly funded vaccine. The publicly funded vaccine is available from a variety of vaccine providers, including public health clinics, pharmacies, travel clinics and some doctors' offices.
In BC, the influenza vaccine is publicly funded for people at high risk of serious illness from influenza, people able to transmit or spread influenza to those at high risk of serious illness from influenza, people who provide essential community services, and farmers and other people who work with live poultry.

","In Canada, measles vaccine protection is only available in the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine. Combination vaccines take two or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. This is done with the MMR vaccine and other childhood vaccines for many reasons:

		Children get the same protection as they do from individual vaccines were given separately€”but with fewer shots

		Fewer shots may mean less pain for your child and less stress for you when the child is in pain/fewer vaccine appointments

		Combining vaccines into fewer shots may mean that more children will get recommended vaccinations on time. And that means fewer delays in disease protection for children

","It is important to report any unexpected reactions after a vaccine to your health care provider. In the 24 hours after an influenza vaccine, fewer than 1 in 20 people may have oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS).  ORS symptoms include: red eyes and a cough and/or sore throat and/or hoarseness.

489,"Which vaccine would cause the vaccinated individual to become an asymptomatic carrier of a disease? If they come in contact with it. Meaning they could spread it to babies etc. If you cant answer this i question your ability to advise people to vaccinate due to lacking knowledge.
","Live attenuated vaccines are made from a weakened version of the germ (virus or bacteria) that causes the disease. When a person receives a live vaccine, the germ in the vaccine multiplies (grows) in the body and stimulates an immune response almost identical to that produced by natural infection. Because it is weakened, the vaccine germ cannot multiply enough to cause disease in people with healthy immune systems. If there are any special precautions to be taken after receiving a live attenuated vaccine, the healthcare provider will review with you. For example:

		very rarely, a person who develops a rash after being immunized can spread the virus from the chickenpox vaccine. To prevent spreading it to others, cover the rash until the blisters have dried and crusted over.

		the virus from the rotavirus vaccine may be found in a baby's stool for at least 10 days after immunization. Parents and caregivers should wash their hands thoroughly after changing diapers.
Remember, it is much safer to get the vaccine than get the disease it prevents. If you have more questions, speak with your immunizing healthcare provider.

","Finding Your Immunization Records 
ImmunizeBC does not have access to your immunization records.  If you need a copy of your immunization records, there are several places you can look:

		Check your home for your paper record of immunization.  Try looking through baby books or other saved documents from your childhood.

		Check with your parents or other caregivers to see if they have a record of your immunizations.

		Check with your previous family doctors. Keep in mind that immunization records are kept at doctors' offices for a limited time.

		Check with your Occupational Health department if vaccines were provided by them.

		Check with your local public health unit if you were immunized at the health unit or in school.
Without a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.  It is safe to repeat vaccines.  You can also have your blood tested for antibodies to determine your immunity to certain diseases. Your health care provider can help you determine what is best for you.

","The HPV vaccine is recommended for adult women up to 45 years of age.  Women may be immunized even if they have had a known HPV infection or have had previous Pap abnormalities (including cervical cancer).  Women who have had a known HPV infection will benefit from receiving the vaccine for the HPV types for which they have not been exposed.  The likelihood of having been exposed to all types of HPV contained in the vaccine is low (the HPV9 vaccine protects against 9 different types of HPV). HPV vaccines do not treat infections. 
The nurses at ImmunizeBC only provide general information about immunization and do not provide individual consults.  It is recommended that the woman you are referring to follows up with her health care provider who can make an individual recommendation for her.

","Vaccines are among the safest medical products available, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. For example, the estimated annual reported rate of anaphylaxis ranges from 0.4 to 1.8 reports per 1,000,000 doses of vaccine distributed in Canada. These statistics include all vaccine doses; not just those given to babies. The vast majority of side effects from vaccines are minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever.  The risks from the diseases vaccines prevent are much greater than the risk of a vaccine side effect.

","It is not safe for a 2-month-old to have contact with anyone who has pertussis (whooping cough), regardless of whether or not they have received their 2-month vaccines. Infants need multiple doses of the pertussis vaccine to be protected and even when the recommended number of doses have been received, protection cannot be guaranteed. 
Pertussis can cause complications such as pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. These complications happen most often in infants under 1 year of age. 
Further, anyone who has contact with someone with pertussis is at risk of contracting pertussis and passing it onto others, including infants.

","In Canada, the HPV vaccines (HPV2, HPV9) protect against 2 types of HPV that cause about 70% of cases of cervical cancer and 80% of cases of anal cancer. The HPV9 vaccine protects against 5 additional types of HPV that cause 15% to 20% of cervical cancers and 11% of anal cancers in women and 4% in men. The HPV9 vaccine also protects against 2 types of HPV that cause about 90% of cases of genital warts.
More than 99% of vaccine recipients develop an antibody response to vaccine HPV types after completing a 3-dose series. The body usually starts to develop an immune response within 2 weeks after immunization with most vaccines and then the second and third doses of the vaccine boost that immune response.
If you are concerned about recent exposure to HPV or other sexually transmitted infections, please go to Smart Sex Resource for more information.

We recommend that you discuss your concerns with your family doctor or a public health nurse.  If following this discussion you decide that you would still like for your child to receive only one vaccine at a time (per clinic visit) this can be accommodated. A 2 month old typically receives 3 injectable vaccines and one oral vaccine at 2 months of age.
	Some information to consider: Combination vaccines are safe. They provide all the benefits of the individual vaccines but in a single injection, so your child does not need to receive as many shots. Before a combination vaccine is approved for use, studies must show that the combination vaccine is just as safe and effective as each of the individual vaccines given separately. Research shows that the side effects of combination vaccines are similar to those of the individual vaccines given separately. The vast majority of side effects are very mild, such as temporary pain and swelling at the injection site.
The ingredients in vaccines have been carefully studied for a long time, and are safe in the small amounts used in vaccines. You may have heard or read that some ingredients are harmful, but this is true only at much higher amounts. Any substance, even water, can be harmful at a high dose. There is no evidence that any of the ingredients in these small amounts can cause harm.
You can visit our Ingredients section for more information on the safety of vaccine ingredients and the Vaccine Safety section.

568,"If a family member has chosen not to vaccinate their child until 4 - and we have a 3 month old baby who is just beginning his immunizations is it safe to expose baby?
","A baby who has received their 2 month immunizations will have some protection against the diseases they were immunized against, however they will not be fully protected.  This is because more than one dose of these vaccines is needed for full protection. There are also some diseases (such a measles, mumps and rubella and chicken pox) for which children are not routinely vaccinated against until 12 months of age. So your child would be at risk of getting  a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child if the unvaccinated child were to catch that disease. Also, infants and young children are at higher risk of serious illness if they catch a vaccine-preventable disease due to their immature immune systems and physical development.  Once a child has received all of their immunizations, their risk of getting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child (or adult) decreases.  There may be many instances in which your child may be in an environment in which there may be people who are not immunized.  It is important to weigh the risks and benefits in making the decision as to whether you want your child to be in that environment.  We encourage you to discuss this further with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse. You will find the phone number for your health unit here.

569,"vaccine is a small amount of weak germ. so my thinking is antibody production against vaccine will weak and small amount. is it true?
","Vaccines contain a small amount of the germs or parts of the germs that cause disease. The germs in vaccines are either killed or weakened so they can't make you sick. When you receive a vaccine, your body thinks the small amount of the disease germ is the disease itself, and your immune system starts creating antibodies (proteins that destroy disease germs). These antibodies stay with you for a long time and remember how to fight off the germ. If the real disease (not the vaccine) enters your body in the future, the antibodies are ready to fight it off before it has a chance to make you sick. Often, your body remembers how to fight a germ for the rest of your life. However, sometimes you need a booster dose of a vaccine to remind your body how to fight off certain germs. Most vaccines need more than one dose over time to produce full protection. That's why it's important to follow the immunization schedule - it gives the best protection with the fewest doses of each vaccine. Vaccines are very effective and much safer than getting the diseases they prevent.

","Yes. Vaccines protect children against diseases that can cause serious illness and death. Before vaccines were available, many Canadian children were hospitalized or died from diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles. Today, such diseases are rarely seen in Canada. However, the germs that cause these diseases still exist, and some of these diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough), measles and mumps still occur in small numbers in Canada. If vaccination rates drop, these small numbers of diseases could quickly become outbreaks and epidemics of disease. We have seen this happen in other countries.
When children get vaccinated, they don't just protect themselves, they help to protect their entire community too. We call this herd immunity. For more information on herd immunity and how immunization protects the population, check this link.

653,"My daughter in law got an mmr vaccine before leaving for travel about 7 days ago. This morning she woke up with a huge rash. Is this normal
","Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live vaccine and contains a weakened form of the viruses that it protects against. A mild fever, a rash that looks like measles and swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck can occur about 7 to 12 days after getting the vaccine. Six to 23 days after immunization with MMR vaccine, approximately 5% of immunized children experience malaise and fever (with or without rash) lasting up to 3 days. This is more common with the first dose of MMR vaccine than the second dose.
Your daughter-in-law may contact the health care provider who gave the MMR vaccine with any questions or concerns about potential vaccine side effects. She may also contact her local health unit. Use the health unit finder.
Registered nurses at HealthLink BC can help with non-emergency health concerns, to discuss symptoms and to recommend whether to see a health care provider in person. Call 8-1-1 anytime.

","The polio vaccine is mostly given as a booster dose to adults who had a series of polio vaccine in childhood and are at increased risk of exposure to the polio virus (for example, through work or travel).
The schedule for the polio vaccine for an adult who has never been immunized is 3 doses. The second dose is given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 1 and the 3rd dose is given 6 to 12 months after the 2nd dose. You can also contact a pharmacy or a travel clinic to arrange to be immunized.

","ImmunizeBC does not have access to your child's immunization records. If you need a copy of your child's immunization records, there are several places you can look:
Check your home for your child's paper record of immunizations.  Try looking through baby books or other saved documents.  In BC, childhood immunizations are most often recorded in the Child Health Passport.
	Check with your local public health unit if your child was immunized at the health unit. Public health units in BC maintain an electronic registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health nurses.
	Check with your child's doctor if your child was immunized at their doctor's office.
Children without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected. These children should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.  It is safe to repeat vaccines.  Children can also have their blood tested for antibodies to determine their immunity to certain diseases.

","You should discuss this with your health care provider, as the answer depends on the surgery you are having (if you will receive blood products) and the vaccine you need (whether it is an inactivated or live vaccine). In general:

		There is minimal or no interaction between blood products and inactivated vaccines, such as hepatitis B and tetanus/diphtheria (Td) vaccines. An inactivated vaccine does not have timing rules before/after blood products.

		Blood products can interfere with the immune response to live vaccines such as the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) or  chickenpox (varicella) vaccines. A live vaccine does have timing rules both before/after blood products. If a blood product is administered less than 14 days after the MMR or chickenpox vaccine, it should be repeated at again at a later date.

		there is no risk of getting tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in Canada. TBE is found across Europe and Asia, spanning: Eastern France to Northern China and Japan; Northern Russia to Albania. 

		TBE is present in some areas of Switzerland and the TBE vaccine can be considered for travellers to this country.

","In Canada, the responsibility for health care, including immunization, is shared by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.  Each province and territory maintains its own system for tracking immunization coverage and in BC there is no central registry. In most provinces and territories, immunization data is collected mainly on children. How provinces and territories record childhood immunization data may be different. Some jurisdictions have electronic databases to track childhood immunization data, while others use paper-based systems. Some use a combination of both.
Health care providers must maintain a record of all vaccines that they give and each person that receives a vaccine should be given a permanent personal immunization record. They should be reminded to keep the record in a safe place and to present it at every health care visit so that it can be updated.
An example of an adult personal immunization record is available from Immunize Canada.
You may also be interested in the CANImmunize app which allows you to store your immunizations and receive reminders about upcoming immunization.

","Vaccines contain small amounts of specific ingredients, all of which play necessary and important roles. The ingredients in vaccines have been carefully studied for a long time, and are safe in the small amounts used in vaccines. 
Aluminum is used in vaccines as an adjuvant. Adjuvants help improve the immune response to a vaccine (help the vaccine work better). Aluminum has been used safely in vaccines for over 70 years. It is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food, and water. In the first 6 months of life, infants receive more aluminum in their diet than from vaccines.  You can read more about vaccine safety and aluminum in vaccines here.
Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, is added to influenza vaccines produced in multi-dose vials. It is added to prevent bacterial growth.  It has been used safely in vaccines for over 80 years. Today, all routine childhood vaccines used in B.C. (except certain flu vaccines) are produced in single-dose vials and do not require thimerosal. You can read more about vaccine safety and thimerosal in vaccines here.
You can find more information on vaccine ingredients here.

","When pregnant, a woman can only share antibodies against those infectious diseases she is immune to from vaccination or past disease. If present, measles antibodies (IgG) are shared through the placenta, from a woman to her developing baby. After birth, the amount of antibodies the baby has and how long they last for vary depending on the mother's level of antibodies, whether the baby was born premature etc. Breastfeeding primarily provides IgA antibodies, which mostly protect against diseases that affect the gut, such as diarrheal infections, not measles. In BC, the first dose of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine is given at 12 months of age when the mother's antibodies are no longer circulating in amounts that will interfere with the baby's immune response to the MMR vaccine.

822,"If my child is one of the 0.4 to 1.8 reports per 1,000,000 doses of vaccine distributed in Canada who get anaphylaxis, how do I explain to his mother it was worth it?
","Anaphylaxis is preventable in many cases and treatable in all. Prevention of anaphylaxis is important. Pre-vaccination screening includes screening for a history of anaphylaxis and identification of potential risk factors. The standard information provided in the process of obtaining informed consent prior to giving vaccines includes the provision of emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. While anaphylaxis is extremely rare, every immunization carries a risk of producing an anaphylactic (life threatening allergic) reaction. 
All immunizing health care providers in BC are required to be trained on how to recognize and treat anaphylaxis immediately. Anaphylaxis management kits are readily available wherever vaccines are administered, containing epinephrine (the first line treatment for anaphylaxis) to stop the allergic reaction. If anaphylaxis were to occur, the health care provider gives epinephrine to reverse the allergic reaction and calls 9-1-1 to arrange for rapid transport by emergency vehicle to an emergency department. Please speak with your immunizing health care provider for further questions about vaccine safety and anaphylaxis.

825,"I think my sons (born in 1992 and 1993)only got one dose of mumps vaccine, since the addition of a second dose was instituted in 1996. Maybe they got another in gr. 6 in BC?
","The mumps vaccine is combined with the measles and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine).  People born in 1992 and 1993 in BC would have likely received one dose of the MMR vaccine as part of their routine immunizations.  
The provincial mumps vaccine recommendations are outlined below. These recommendations may be different for select populations (for example, health care workers) and in outbreak situations.  There have been a small number of recently confirmed mumps cases in BC, however BC is not currently experiencing a mumps outbreak. 
Mumps vaccine recommendations:
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine (usually given as the MMR vaccine) is recommended for adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a history of mumps disease and laboratory confirmation of the same. The following groups need two doses:

		children as per the routine schedule

		students of post-secondary educational settings

		travelers to outside of North America
People born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to mumps from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those who do not have a history of mumps disease or vaccine should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.    
For measles protection, two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended for people born in 1970 or later (who do not have laboratory evidence of measles immunity).
If you are unsure if your sons are up-to-date with their immunizations, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse. A public health nurse can review their immunization records and let you know if they are missing any recommended vaccines.  
An important note about immunization records:
Without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity to a disease, a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected.  You can find tips on locating immunization records here. 
Vaccination is the best protection against mumps. For more information on the MMR vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine.
For information about mumps disease, see the HealthLinkBC File: Mumps.

","In BC, the MMR vaccine is a vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. This live vaccine contains weakened forms of the measles, mumps and rubella viruses that do not cause disease. It takes about two weeks after the MMR vaccine for antibodies to develop in the body that protect against these viruses.

The HPV vaccine is highly effective and more than 99% of vaccine recipients develop an antibody response to HPV9  after completing a 3-dose series. The body usually starts to develop an immune response within 2 weeks after immunization with most vaccines and then the second and third doses of the vaccine boost that immune response.

","BC started providing measles vaccine in 1969 and it was recommended for infants at 12 months of age, preschool, and susceptible school children. Adults born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection. However, there may be susceptible people in this age group, and those without a history of measles disease or vaccination should talk to their health care provider about getting vaccinated.  Health care workers born in 1957 or later, who do not have evidence of immunity to measles, need two doses of measles-containing vaccine.  Health care workers born before 1957 are considered immune to measles. Please call your immunization provider or local public health office if you have further questions.

","If you have questions about measles disease you can go to HealthLinkBC's measles information or call HealthLinkBC at 8-1-1. Complications of measles disease can lead to:

		infections of the ear or lungs (pneumonia).

		More serious complications, occurring in 1 person in 1,000, include encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. This can lead to seizures, deafness or permanent brain damage.

		About one person in 3,000 with measles can die from complications.
Children under the age of 19 who are able to understand the benefits and possible reactions for each vaccine, and the risk of not getting immunized, can legally consent to or refuse immunizations. This means that your child may decide for his or herself whether or not to receive a vaccine.  More information on mature minor consent can be found here.

		For all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (given as MMR) are recommended. Individuals born in 1970 or later with documentation of two doses of a measles-containing vaccine are considered immune and no booster doses are recommended. 

		Individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals.

","Vaccines (such as the hepatitis B vaccine) work by stimulating a person's immune system to make antibodies (proteins that fight off germs).  The antibodies remain in the body and will protect against the germ (for example, the hepatitis B virus) if a person is exposed to it in the future. The hepatitis B vaccine provides long-term protection against the hepatitis B virus; however, protection is not immediate (it usually takes several weeks to develop antibodies against the germ).
HBIg is hepatitis B immune globulin (immune globulins are different from vaccines). It contains large amounts of hepatitis B antibodies taken from donated human blood. It is given (as a shot) when immediate protection against hepatitis B is needed (for example, to prevent hepatitis B infection in people who have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus and have not received the hepatitis B vaccine).  HBIg provides immediate protection because it contains pre-formed antibodies to hepatitis B.  However, the protection is only short-term.

	The best protection against these diseases is vaccination. If your child is too young to get the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, the best way to protect your child is to ensure everyone around your child is vaccinated (close contacts, care providers etc).  If you live in a community where there is currently a measles outbreak and would like more information on how to protect your child, we encourage you to contact your local public health unit and ask to speak with a public health nurse.

Ensuring that people who are in close contact with your newborn are up to date with their immunizations can help protect your newborn, as can general infection control methods such as frequent hand washing.

905,"I have the flu. Should I still get the flu shot' and will it help with this flu?
","The influenza (flu) vaccine  helps prevent influenza, it does not treat influenza.
People who have already been sick with an influenza-like illness this season should still get vaccinated.  Here are the reasons why:

		It's possible that the influenza-like illness was not caused by an influenza virus as there are other respiratory viruses circulating along with influenza that can have influenza-like symptoms.  

		The seasonal influenza vaccine protects against three or four different types of influenza viruses, which means even if a person has been sick with one influenza virus, the vaccine will still offer protection against two or three other influenza viruses.
Influenza vaccination should usually be postponed in people with serious acute illness until their symptoms have subsided. Vaccination should not be delayed because of minor acute illness, with or without fever. We recommend that you follow up with your immunizing health care provider who can make a recommendation for you.

","Tips for locating immunization records are here.
Without a record of immunization (or proof of immunity to a disease), a person is considered unimmunized and unprotected and should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection. It is safe to repeat vaccines. For a limited number of vaccine preventable diseases, you can also have your blood tested for antibodies to determine your immunity. Your health care provider can help you determine what is best for you.

909,"Can I pick and choose which vaccines I want my child to get?
","Immunization is not mandatory in B.C., and thus a parent is able to choose which vaccines their child gets. However, for best protection against disease, it is strongly advised that children get all of the recommended vaccines and that they get them on time (according to the recommended schedule). 
Infants and young children are at greater risk from vaccine-preventable diseases because their immune systems are less mature, and less able to fight off infection. If an infant or young child were to get a vaccine-preventable disease, it could be very serious and life-threatening. Following the recommended schedule provides the best protection as early as possible.
We encourage you to discuss your concerns further with your family doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.
You can read more about why it's important to follow the recommended schedule here. You can read about the risks and responsibilities associated with delaying vaccination or choosing to skip vaccines here.

The Td vaccine is used in Canada, not the DT vaccine.  The Td vaccine protects against tetanus and diphtheria. This vaccine is routinely given as a booster dose to adults every 10 years and is also given to adults who have not been immunized.  The vaccine may also be given to people with serious cuts of deep wounds if their last tetanus vaccine was given more than 5 years ago. 
Diphtheria is a serious infection of the nose and throat caused by diphtheria bacteria.

","Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles (varicella zoster virus), can spread from a person with active shingles to cause chickenpox in someone who has never had chickenpox or received two doses of a chickenpox vaccine. It is important to know whether your grandchildren have had either chickenpox disease or two doses of the chickenpox vaccine.
A person with active shingles can spread the virus through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer infectious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If you have shingles, you should:

		Cover the rash, avoid touching or scratching the rash and wash your hands often to prevent the spread of the virus.

		Avoid close contact with people until after the rash blisters heal (develop crusts).

		It is especially important to avoid contact with people who are at special risk from chickenpox, such as: pregnant women, infants, children, or anyone who has never had chickenpox; anyone who is currently ill; anyone with a weak immune system who is unable to fight infection (such as someone with HIV infection or diabetes).

If you are concerned that your child may have a serious or unexpected reaction after a vaccine, contact the health care provider who gave the vaccine. Under the Public Health Act in BC, all health care providers who become aware of an AEFI must report it.

988,"I've heard that new studies are coming out stating the HPV vaccine may affect fertility in the future is this correct?
","Extensive research has shown no evidence that the HPV vaccine can cause infertility. In fact, HPV cancers can lead to issues with fertility. The HPV vaccine protects against cancers caused by HPV. You can learn more about the HPV vaccine here. 
The HPV vaccine is very safe. Vaccines are approved for use in Canada only if they meet very strict standards for safety and effectiveness. The HPV vaccine was well studied in clinical trials and was not approved for use in Canada until the studies showed that it was safe and effective. Since vaccine licensure, hundreds of millions of doses of HPV vaccines have been distributed worldwide. Vaccine safety monitoring has continued to show that the HPV vaccine is safe. You can learn more about vaccine safety here. 
If you have further questions or concerns, we recommend that you speak with your doctor or a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local health unit here.

995,"My daughter is 21. Followed the usual baby immunization schedule at our Dr's New West office, then school shots in Langley. Lost the records and she needs it for University. Help?
","ImmunizeBC does not have access to your child's immunization records. If you need a copy of your child's immunization records, there are several places you can look:

		Check your home for your child's paper record of immunizations.  Try looking through baby books or other saved documents.  In BC, childhood immunizations are most often recorded in the Child Health Passport.

		Check with your local public health unit if your child was immunized at the health unit or in school. Public health units in BC maintain an electronic registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health nurses.

		Check with your daughter's doctor for vaccines provided at the doctor's office.
People without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected. These people should generally be vaccinated (or revaccinated) to ensure protection.  It is safe to repeat vaccines.  People can also have their blood tested for antibodies to determine their immunity to certain diseases. Your child's health care provider can help you determine what is best for your child.
