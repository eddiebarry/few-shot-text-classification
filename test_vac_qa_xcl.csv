ImmunizeBC does not have access to your son's immunization records. If he needs a copy of his immunization records, there are several places to look:

		Check your home for your son's paper record of immunizations.  Try looking through baby books or other saved documents.  In BC, childhood immunizations are most often recorded in the Child Health Passport.

		He can check with the local public health unit if he was immunized at the health unit or in school. Public health units in BC now maintain an electronic registry of childhood immunizations provided by public health nurses but in 1986 they would have been in paper form.

		He can check with his doctor if he was immunized at the doctor's office.
Individuals without immunization records (or proof of immunity to a disease) are considered unimmunized and unprotected.

48,"Why is Hepatitis B vaccine given to infants now instead of in grade 6
","The grade 6 hepatitis B immunization program that BC introduced in 1992 was effective in eliminating hepatitis B infection among successive grade 6 cohorts. However, cases of acute hepatitis B continued to occur in the province, affecting children younger than grade 6 age. In 2001 a universal hepatitis B immunization program for infants was introduced with the aim of eliminating childhood hepatitis B infection in the province.
	Providing the hepatitis B vaccine in infancy protects against infection when the risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection is highest.  The younger a person is when they become infected with hepatitis B, the greater the risk of the person becoming a chronic carrier. Infants have a 90% to 95% chance, children over one year and less than 5 years of age 25% to 50% chance, and adolescents and adults 3% to 10% chance of developing chronic infection. 
	If you would like more information about the hepatitis B vaccine or about hepatitis B, we recommend that you contact your local public health unit and ask to speak to a public health nurse. You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here.

","Read about why it's important to vaccinate here. Learn about the risks of choosing not to vaccinate here.
Vaccines are among the safest medical products available, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects. Many people who receive vaccines have no side effects. For those that do, the side effects are usually very minor, like soreness, redness, or swelling where the vaccine was given, or a mild fever. These effects will generally subside after a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. Read more about vaccine safety.
Before getting a vaccine, your health care provider will tell you about the possible side effects of the vaccine(s).

However, if a live vaccine is given on the previous day or earlier, the TB test should be delayed for at least 4 weeks (28 days).

","MMR vaccine is part of the publicly-funded (free) immunization program in BC and a prescription is not required. 

		For all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (given as MMR in Canada) are recommended. Individuals born in 1970 or later with documentation of two doses of a measles-containing vaccine are considered immune and no booster doses are recommended.

		Individuals born before 1970 are generally assumed to have acquired immunity to measles from natural infection, and therefore MMR vaccine is not recommended for these individuals.
Learn more about measles and the MMR vaccine here. 
In BC, many health professions are authorized to immunize including nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physicians and naturopathic doctors. Contact the clinic of your choice to inquire if they provide immunizations. In BC, all health units provide immunizations. Use the health unit finder.

","Vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines strengthen the immune system and make it ready to fight vaccine-preventable diseases. They harness and train it to quickly defend against vaccine-preventable diseases before illness can occur. Vaccines greatly reduce the risk of infection by working with the body's natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease. The immune system uses several tools to fight infection. It enlists the help of white blood cells to fight infection, produce antibodies and make cells called memory cells, which go into action quickly if the body encounters the same germ again.

118,"Why does a 2 month old baby need tetanus and hep B in the preliminary immunization shot? My grand daughter asked me and I don't know the answer.
","The immunization schedule is designed to protect children before they are exposed to vaccine-preventable diseases. Children are immunized early in life because they are vulnerable to diseases and the consequences can be very serious.
It is important that children are immunized against tetanus and hepatitis B because these are serious and sometimes fatal diseases. 
The bacteria that cause tetanus can be found everywhere in the environment (usually in dirt and soil). When the bacteria enter the skin through a cut or scrape, they produce a poison that can cause painful tightening of muscles all over the body. It is very serious if the breathing muscles are affected. Up to 1 in 5 people who get tetanus may die.  
Hepatitis B can cause serious disease including permanent liver damage and is the main cause of liver cancer. When young children get infected with the hepatitis B virus they often do not have symptoms but most will stay infected for life. This is why getting protection from the vaccine at a young age is important. 
You can find more information in our Diseases & Vaccination section. 
A Parent's Guide to Vaccination from the Public Health Agency of Canada is another great resource for parents.

The Federation of Independant Schools Associations may be able to provide you with more information regarding this or refer you to someone who can. 
It is recommended that children are up-to-date with their immunizations prior to entering a childcare facility or school.  If someone at a childcare facility or school has a vaccine-preventable disease, children who are unimmunized or who don't have a record of immunization may be asked to stay home until it is safe to return.  This rule is designed to keep unimmunized children from getting sick and to keep the outbreak from spreading.

","Chickenpox is not a reportable communicable disease in BC. A child with chickenpox after the age of one (that was confirmed by a lab test) is considered immune against chickenpox and doesn't need a second dose of the vaccine. If your daughter had her chickenpox confirmed by a lab test, contact your healthcare provider to have it noted in her immunization record.
Chickenpox vaccine is not 100% effective, but a single dose of the vaccine prevents 95% of severe chickenpox disease. Chickenpox infection (more than 42 days after vaccination) is called vaccine modified disease.  Individuals who develop chickenpox after vaccination usually have milder disease.

The shingles vaccine is not publicly funded in BC.  In BC, decisions to fund vaccine programs are made by the Ministry of Health based on recommendations by the Communicable Disease Policy Advisory Committee.  This expert committee makes recommendations based on epidemiology, the best available scientific evidence, a cost benefit analysis and the advice of national and international expert groups, which are then prioritized against other public health initiatives.  Some health insurance plans may cover the cost of the shingles vaccine.

","In general, protection starts to develop after about two weeks of getting a vaccine; however, a number of factors impact an individuals' response to vaccines. When travelling internationally, you and your baby may be at risk for a number of diseases that are rarely found in Canada but are common in other parts of the world. Travel vaccines will provide you and your baby with important protection. Consult your health care provider or visit a travel health clinic as early as possible, and preferably at least six weeks before travel. This is important because some vaccines may take several weeks to become fully effective, and others may require more than one dose.

","For best protection, it is recommended that children adhere as closely as possible to the recommended schedule.
Postponing the 6 month vaccination is an option, however the risk with postponing vaccines is that it leaves children at risk for disease longer and at a time when they are most vulnerable.  
Whether or not your child can receive the 6 month vaccination early (and it be considered a valid dose) depends on the minimum intervals for the vaccine (these are the required amounts of time that must pass between vaccine doses) and the minimum age for that dose.  However, in certain situations, such as travel, vaccination may still be recommended even if minimum interval and age requirements are not met. 
We recommend that you follow up with your immunizing health care provider who can make a recommendation for your child.

		Eye herpes (ocular herpes) is a common, recurrent viral infection affecting the eyes caused by the type 1 herpes simplex virus.

		Chickenpox infection is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The chickenpox virus stays in the body and later in life it can become reactivated causing shingles (herpes zoster).

","According to the Canadian Immunization Guide, protection from the hepatitis A vaccine is likely to last at least 20 years and possibly for life.  Protection from the hepatitis B vaccine is likely to last for life (however booster doses may be recommended for certain populations and for some individuals, a blood test may be recommended to ensure adequate protection against hepatitis B). Protection from the typhoid vaccine is thought to last for either about three or seven years, depending on the type of typhoid vaccine received (booster doses may be recommended sooner). This is assuming all of the recommended doses of these vaccines are received as per the recommended schedules and that the person who received these vaccines is healthy.
If you are wondering if your immunizations are up-to-date and if you are considered to be protected against these diseases, it is recommended that you follow up with your immunizing health care provider or local travel clinic (if you are travelling). Your health care provider (or the doctor, nurse or pharmacist at the travel clinic) can review your immunization record, tell you if you are considered up-to-date for these vaccines and recommend and provide any missing vaccines.  You can find a list of travel clinics in BC here.

","Although the two words are often used interchangeably, the CDC defines the two as follows:
Vaccination: The act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease.
Immunization: A process by which a person becomes protected against a disease through vaccination. This term is often used interchangeably with vaccination or inoculation.

226,"Last time i got a vaccine for flu(vaxigrip) and pneumococal was march 01, 2013. Am I scheduled for another vaccine?
","A flu vaccine is needed every year for two reasons. First, your immunity declines over time, so a yearly vaccine is needed for optimal protection. Second, because flu viruses are constantly changing, the formulation of the flu vaccine is reviewed each year and sometimes updated to keep up with changing flu viruses. For the best protection, everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated every year.
One dose of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is routinely recommended for adults 65 years of age and older. However, a 2nd dose (offered 5 years after the initial dose) is recommended for people with certain medical conditions. We recommend that you speak with your health care provider to find out if you need a 2nd dose of the vaccine and to find out if there are any other vaccines you need.

","A different immunization schedule is recommended for children who are 1 year of age and older but less than 7 years of age when starting immunization.  This schedule uses minimum intervals (the shortest time between two doses of a vaccine in a multi-dose series in which a protective response to the subsequent dose can be expected) to ensure children are caught up on their immunizations as quickly as possible.  The vaccine dosages are not altered; however, children following this schedule receive fewer doses of vaccines overall than they would have received if they were immunized on time as per the routine schedule.
A public health nurse can review this schedule with you and can also schedule an immunization appointment for your child.  You can find the contact information for your local public health unit here: http://www.immunizebc.ca/finder .

Parents can choose to not follow BC's routine immunization schedule, but this is not recommended because:

		There is no known benefit to delaying or spacing out vaccines.

		Schedules that delay or space out vaccines leave your child at risk of getting diseases while they are unvaccinated.

		Delaying or spacing out vaccines will increase the number of visits to your child's health care provider, which may increase your child's risk of developing anxiety and needle fear.

","Medicines are given at different doses based on body weight. Medicines work when a certain level is present in the bloodstream; therefore, the weight of a person is important. Vaccines work differently.
For a vaccine to work, the cells of the immune system are important, and because of this vaccines typically require very low amounts of active ingredients. Immune system cells are throughout the body, and they respond to the vaccine right where the vaccine is given. It is then the immune system cells, (not the vaccines) that travel throughout the body to help the body fight off the vaccine-preventable virus or bacteria in the future. The dose (amount) of a vaccine given is researched and chosen during the phases of vaccine development, different doses are tested to determine the lowest effective dose for the target age group. There are specific adult and pediatric versions of many vaccines with different levels of active ingredients to ensure that the age group is protected against that disease.

","The tetanus vaccine is not available on its own.  The tetanus vaccine is combined with other vaccines so a person can receive protection from several diseases with one shot.  Several different vaccines are used to prevent tetanus among infants, children, adolescents and adults.  The vaccine routinely given to adults as a booster dose is the Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine.  
Adults who were immunized against tetanus and diphtheria when they were younger should get a booster dose of the Td vaccine every 10 years. This booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases.

A person without a record of immunization, or proof of immunity, is considered unimmunized and unprotected.  In general, it is advised that people without written documentation of immunization get immunized according to the schedule for their current age.  Getting extra doses of vaccine is not harmful and ensures protection. However, immunity to Hep B can be checked through a blood test. We recommend that you discuss this further with your public health nurse or doctor.

","In BC, parents have the authority to provide consent for their child regardless of the child's age. (Except when a parents' decision-making rights have been legally revoked or when their child has consented as a mature minor on their own behalf). Both parents are not required to be present for a health care provider to obtain consent to give immunizations.
A health care provider must defer the consent process if a parent discloses there are differences between parents who have equal authority to consent to their child's immunization. The health care provider cannot proceed with immunizations until a parent reports these differences are resolved. If you have further concerns around informed consent for immunizations, speak with a nurse at your local health unit. Use the health unit finder.

","Vaccines do not cause autism. There is no scientific evidence of a link between vaccines and autism. Because children with autism are often diagnosed after the age when they receive some vaccines, some people have argued that vaccines cause autism. But just because one thing happens after another, it does not mean there is a link between them.
Much of the controversy around a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism came from a single small study published in 1998. The study was found to be fraudulent and was withdrawn by the journal that published it. Many large scientific studies around the world have since been conducted and have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

","We do not have immunization records at ImmunizeBC or information on when vaccines were offered in other provinces. Below is some information on pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine recommendations for adults.
It is recommended that all adults receive one dose of the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if they have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood. In particular, adults who have not previously received pertussis-containing vaccines in adulthood, and who anticipate having regular contact with an infant, should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine, ideally administered at least 2 weeks before contact with the infant.  Ensuring your pertussis vaccination is up-to-date can provide indirect protection to infants.
Due to the current incidence of pertussis activity in BC, an adult dose of the Tdap vaccine is not provided for free to adults who were immunized in childhood.  Those not eligible for the free vaccine can purchase the vaccine at most pharmacies and travel clinics.  A dose of the Tdap vaccine is however provided for free to adults who have never been immunized against pertussis, or whose immunization history is unknown (adults lacking adequate documentation of immunization are considered unimmunized). Those eligible for the free vaccine can get vaccinated at their local public health unit or pharmacy.  Some family doctors also provide immunizations. 
Protection from pertussis vaccines decreases over time, so it's important to get a booster dose.  We recommend that you discuss getting vaccinated further with your public health nurse, doctor or pharmacist who can make a recommendation for you. 
For more information about the Tdap vaccine, see the HealthLinkBC File: Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap) Vaccine.

For example, my husband is vaccinated and is a teacher. If he was to be exposed to measles at work could he bring it home and pass it onto an infant?
","Measles vaccine is very effective and with the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine efficacy (vaccine's ability to prevent illness in research studies) approaches 100%. The MMR vaccine works with the body's immune system to produce antibodies to the measles virus. When an individual is fully vaccinated against measles and then exposed to the virus, the body recognizes and destroys the measles virus so that individual doesn't get sick. For your husband to bring home measles and pass it onto an infant, he would have to be exposed and infected/develop measles disease.

For the 2018/19 influenza season, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization concluded that there is good evidence that Fluzone® High-Dose provides better protection compared with standard-dose influenza vaccines for adults 65 years of age and older. 

		Fluzone® High-Dose contains four times the antigen (the part of the vaccine that prompts the body to make antibodies) of a standard-dose influenza vaccine. The additional antigen is intended to create a stronger immune response (more antibodies) in older individuals, who generally respond at lower levels than younger individuals.

		Fluad® is a MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine for use in adults 65 years of age and older. Fluad® may be effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization for influenza and influenza complications in the elderly compared to unvaccinated individuals.

","It is not clear to which initiative you are referring.  Do you mean the Vaccination Status Reporting?
In Canada, the responsibility for health care, including immunization, is shared by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.  Each province and territory maintains its own system for tracking immunization coverage. In most provinces and territories, immunization data is collected mainly on children. How provinces and territories record childhood immunization data may be different. Some jurisdictions have electronic databases to track childhood immunization data, while others use paper-based systems. Some use a combination of both. New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Ontario and now BC have immunization reporting requirements. The Province of Ontario has similar requirements as B.C. Under Ontario's immunization legislation (law), parents must report their child's immunizations to their local medical health officer. You can learn more about Ontario's reporting law here.

392,"If my child has been vaccinated, is it safe for her to be around children that have not been vaccinated?
","While vaccinations are highly effective, and greatly decrease the chance of contracting preventable diseases, no vaccine is 100% effective. Depending on the vaccine, about 1% to 5% of children who are vaccinated fail to develop immunity. If these children are exposed to that disease, they could get sick. So your child would be at risk of getting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child if the unvaccinated child were to catch that disease.
Also, infants and young children are at higher risk of serious illness if they catch a vaccine-preventable disease due to their immature immune systems and physical development.  Once a child has received all of their immunizations, their risk of getting a vaccine-preventable disease from an unvaccinated child (or adult) decreases.  There may be many instances in which your child may be in an environment in which there may be people who are not immunized.  It is important to weigh the risks and benefits in making the decision as to whether you want your child to be in that environment.  We encourage you to discuss this further with your primary health care provider or a public health nurse. You will find the phone number for your health unit here.

","The tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine offered in grade 9 is a booster dose for children who were immunized against these diseases at a younger age. Protection from these diseases decreases with time. The booster dose strengthens or boosts the immune system to give better protection against these diseases. 
In early childhood, children are routinely given a series of doses of the tetanus-containing vaccine (the tetanus vaccine is combined with other vaccines).  This is because more than one dose is needed to build immunity and to be protected against disease. Children get a booster dose before they start kindergarten and again in grade 9.  Receiving multiple doses of a vaccine is safe and ensures protection.  You can find the BC's routine vaccine schedules for infants & children and school age children here.

","ImmunizeBC does not have that information. Tips for locating immunization records are here.  According to History of immunization in BC, a Measles/Rubella (MR) campaign was done in 1996 from elementary through post-secondary school students (birth year cohorts 1979-1991).
For all individuals born after January 1, 1970, two doses of measles-containing vaccine are recommended. Read more about measles and the vaccine here.

421,"My son born in 2004 had MMR immunizations on May 2005 and another dose November 2005 as per the recommendations on his Child Health Passport. (2nd dose 12 months after 3rd immunization). His 3rd immunization was November, 2004. Does he need another dose? Thanks
","The routine BC immunization schedule was different in 2004/2005 and the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Vaccine was given at 12 and 18 months of age. Two doses of the MMR vaccine given after 12 months of age (at least 4 weeks apart) are considered valid doses and no further doses are recommended for protection against measles.

422,"My husband is scheduled to start a 6 month regime of Chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy in the middle of November 2019... Could or should he get the flu shot prior to this?
","In general, people who have cancer are considered to be at high-risk for serious illness from influenza (the flu) and should get the inactivated influenza (flu) vaccine. However, the type of treatment your husband will receive may affect the timing of when he should get the vaccine.  It is recommended that your husband speaks with his health care provider about getting vaccinated.
